I‚Äôm KK (Kris Kr√ºg), a creative technologist, AI community builder, and open-source advocate based in Vancouver, Canada. My work bridges generative AI, digital storytelling, ethical tech, and collaborative innovation. This README introduces who I am, what I do, and how you can get involved with my projects, code, and community.

I‚Äôve been building websites and experimenting with open-source software since the mid-1990s, running one of the early open-source startups in Silicon Valley and evangelizing digital empowerment long before it was trendy. My journey has taken me from environmental photojournalism and citizen media to AI-driven storytelling, open data, and community tech leadership. I‚Äôm passionate about making technology accessible, inclusive, and empowering‚Äîespecially for underrepresented voices and creative communities.
