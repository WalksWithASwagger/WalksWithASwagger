I‚Äôm KK (Kris Kr√ºg), a creative technologist, AI community builder, and open-source advocate based in Vancouver, Canada. My work bridges generative AI, digital storytelling, ethical tech, and collaborative innovation. This README introduces who I am, what I do, and how you can get involved with my projects, code, and community.

I‚Äôve been building websites and experimenting with open-source software since the mid-1990s, running one of the early open-source startups in Silicon Valley and evangelizing digital empowerment long before it was trendy. My journey has taken me from environmental photojournalism and citizen media to AI-driven storytelling, open data, and community tech leadership. I‚Äôm passionate about making technology accessible, inclusive, and empowering‚Äîespecially for underrepresented voices and creative communities.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Skills
I‚Äôm a self-taught developer who leverages AI tools and modern frameworks to build, refactor, and prototype solutions quickly‚Äîeven in languages I didn‚Äôt formally learn. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with in 2025:
Programming Languages:
Python (primary for AI/ML, data manipulation, automation)
HTML, JavaScript (web and UI prototyping)
Dart & Flutter (mobile app development)
React Native (cross-platform mobile, refactoring from Dart/Flutter)
Jupyter Notebook (experiments, ML, data viz)
Occasional C#, C++, Go (open-source forks and contributions)‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†
Frameworks & Tools:
FastAPI, Flask (web APIs and backend)
Flutter, React Native (mobile)
OpenAI GPT, Custom GPTs (AI apps, bots, creative tools)
MidJourney, Runway ML, Ideogram (generative media, image/video synthesis)
Notion, Obsidian (personal knowledge management, workflow automation)
Descript, Otter, Fabric (audio/video, transcription, workflow integration)‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†
Development Practices:
Open source first: code, data, and documentation are shared whenever possible.
Focus on workflow hacks, rapid prototyping, and integrating AI into everyday creative and technical processes.
Community-driven: emphasis on collaborative learning, mentorship, and inclusive design‚Å†
